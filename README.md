![Sorting Visualizer Demo](demo.gif)

The **Sorting Visualizer** is a simple web application that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides an interactive way to understand how different sorting algorithms work and how their performance can vary based on input data size.

## Features

- **Sorting Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms come to life! The application provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms, making it easier to grasp their mechanics.

- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose from a selection of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, and more. This allows you to compare the behavior of different algorithms.

- **Adjustable Speed and Size**: Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process step by step. You can also adjust the size of the input data to see how algorithms handle different data volumes.

## Usage

1. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select a sorting algorithm from the available options.

2. **Adjust Speed and Size**: Set the speed of the visualization and the size of the data array using the provided controls.

3. **Visualize**: Click the "Visualize" button to start the sorting process visualization.

4. **Observe and Learn**: Watch as the sorting algorithm rearranges the elements in real time. Observe how each algorithm works and understand their differences.

5. **Experiment and Compare**: Try different algorithms with various input sizes and speeds. Compare their efficiency and behavior.
